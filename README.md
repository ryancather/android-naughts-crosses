# Android Naughts and Crosses
## (Tic-Tac-Toe)

In this tutorial, you'll create an Android app for the user to play Naughts and Crosses. This involves creating the user interface, including nine buttons as well as a label to display information to the user and a button to restart the game.

At the end of the tutorial, your game should run in the simulator as well as on an Android device.

This tutorial is written for use with Android Studio but applying it to Eclipse shouldn't be too difficult.
