## 5. Extension

Congratulations! You've completed an app for Naughts and Crosses!

There are many ways to update and improve this app. You could work towards one of the following:

* Using images to represent the X's and O's
* Use Coloured buttons instead of images or letters
* Update the pushButton() method to use a switch statement instead of lots of if's
* Many, many more
