### 1.2 Android Versions

### 1.4 Name the activity

In this step you can set the name of the Java and User Interface file, but you don't need to do that in this case. 

The only setting you will need to change is the Title. Change that to "Naughts and Crosses" and click Finish.

Your project will then be created and loaded with the required components to run an Android App.

### 1.5 Make a test run

After the project has been created, you'll notice that it displays the Design view of your User Interface. 

You can run this app in the emulator or on a device by clicking the green play button in the tool bar. Android Studio will then prompt you for which device or emulator you wish to run your app on. Choose an appropriate option and click Ok.
